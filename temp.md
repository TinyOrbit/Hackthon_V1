
Yes, discovering new **protein targets** is a foundational step toward curing a disease — but **it's not a cure by itself**.

### Here's how it helps:

1. **Target Identification**: Proteins that play a key role in a disease can be targeted by drugs to modulate their function — either inhibiting or activating them.
2. **Drug Development**: Once a promising protein is identified, drugs (like small molecules or antibodies) can be designed to bind to it effectively, altering the disease pathway.
3. **Precision Medicine**: Target discovery can lead to more specific therapies with fewer side effects compared to general treatments.

### But keep in mind:

* A validated target still needs **years of development** through compound screening, optimization, preclinical and clinical trials before it leads to a real drug.
* Not all targets are "druggable," and not all binding means therapeutic effect.

In short: **Yes, it can help**, but it's the *first mile in a marathon* toward treatment or cure.
